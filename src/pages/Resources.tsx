          <p>Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is a technique that helps reduce anxiety and stress by tensing and then releasing different muscle groups.</p>

          <p>Good sleep hygiene refers to habits that help you have good nighttime sleep quality and full daytime alertness.</p>
          <h3>Key Recommendations:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Consistent schedule:</strong> Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.</li>
            <li><strong>Create a restful environment:</strong> Keep your bedroom quiet, dark, cool, and comfortable.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit screen time:</strong> Avoid screens (phones, tablets, computers) for at least 1 hour before bed.</li>
            <li><strong>Be mindful of food and drinks:</strong> Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and large meals close to bedtime.</li>
            <li><strong>Develop a bedtime routine:</strong> Create relaxing pre-sleep rituals like reading, gentle stretching, or meditation.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit naps:</strong> Short naps (20-30 minutes) are best, and avoid napping late in the day.</li>
            <li><strong>Get regular exercise:</strong> Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you struggle with persistent sleep problems despite good sleep hygiene, consider speaking with a healthcare provider.</p>

            <li><strong>Consistent meals:</strong> Eating regularly helps stabilize blood sugar and mood.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Dehydration can worsen fatigue and brain fog.</li>
            <li><strong>Social connection:</strong> Reach out to one person each day, even with a brief text.</li>
            <li><strong>Gratitude practice:</strong> Note three things you appreciate, no matter how small.</li>
            <li><strong>Achievable goals:</strong> Set and accomplish one small task daily.</li>
